## ðŸŒ¸ Welcome to the Project

This project, crafted by **Gagana**, aims to predict the risk of osteoporosis in patients using machine learning models based on their medical records. Osteoporosis weakens bones, making them fragile and prone to fractures, particularly in older adults. This repository provides a comprehensive analysis to identify at-risk individuals, enabling early intervention and prevention strategies.

## ðŸŒ· Project Overview

The project leverages a dataset of patient medical records to predict osteoporosis risk through:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and removing irrelevant features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Investigating key factors like age, hormonal changes, lifestyle, and medical history.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Training models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Classifier.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score metrics.
- **Feature Importance**: Identifying critical risk factors for osteoporosis.

**Key Finding**: The Decision Tree Classifier achieved an impressive **~87% accuracy**, highlighting age, hormonal changes, medical conditions, and lifestyle as significant risk factors.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset (`data/osteoporosis.csv`) includes features such as:
- **Age**: Patient's age
- **Gender**: Male or Female
- **Hormonal Changes**: Normal or Postmenopausal
- **Family History**: Presence of osteoporosis in family
- **Lifestyle Factors**: Smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity
- **Medical History**: Conditions like Rheumatoid Arthritis or Hyperthyroidism
- **Bone Health**: Calcium and Vitamin D levels

*Note*: Due to potential sensitivity, the dataset is not included in the repository. Please contact the repository owner or refer to the source for access.

## ðŸ’» Usage

Run the Jupyter notebook for an interactive experience:
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/Osteoporosis\ Risk\ Prediction\ by\ Gagana\ &\ Team.ipynb
```

Alternatively, use the modular Python scripts in the `src/` folder:
- `data_preprocessing.py`: Load and clean the dataset.
- `modeling.py`: Train and evaluate machine learning models.
- `visualization.py`: Generate feature importance plots.

## ðŸŒŸ Results

The analysis revealed:
- **Risk Factors**: Age, hormonal changes, medical conditions, medications, low body weight, calcium/vitamin D deficiency, and sedentary lifestyle increase osteoporosis risk.
- **Model Performance**: The Decision Tree Classifier outperformed others with ~87% accuracy, making it a reliable tool for predicting osteoporosis risk.
- **Visualizations**: Feature importance plots highlight the most influential factors across models.

This project empowers healthcare professionals with insights for early intervention and personalized prevention strategies.
